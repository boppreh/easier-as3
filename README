  Currently included in this library:

- boppreh.utils.display

 * bringToFront
 * sendToBack
 * getChildren
 * setParent
 * snapshot
 * tint
 * resetTint
 * Alignment
 * getPosition

  All functions work on any DisplayObject (or DisplayObjectContainer, depending on the function), like Sprites, MovieClips, Bitmaps, TextFields and custom library symbols.

  And they do exactly what it says on the tin.
